Builder

Intent
lets you construct complex objects step by step.
the pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object
using the same construction code.


Problem
Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, 
step-by-step initialization of many fields and nested objects. 
Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters. 
or even worse: scattered all over the client code.

For example, let’s think about how to create a House object.
To build a simple house, you need to construct four walls and a floor, 
install a door, fit a pair of windows, and build a roof. 
But what if you want a bigger, brighter house, 
with a backyard and other goodies (like a heating system, plumbing, and electrical wiring)?




The simplest solution is to extend the base House class and create a set of subclasses
to cover all combinations of the parameters. 
But eventually you’ll end up with a considerable number of subclasses. 
Any new parameter, such as the porch style, will require growing this hierarchy even more.



Solution
The Builder pattern suggests that you extract the object construction code out of its own class
 and move it to separate objects called builders.
